# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from traditional AI that operates in digital spaces to AI systems that function in the real physical world and comprehend physical laws. This textbook explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics, focusing on embodied intelligence - the idea that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its physical environment.

## What You'll Learn

In this comprehensive textbook, you'll explore:

- The fundamentals of Physical AI and embodied intelligence
- ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) for robot control
- Simulation environments using Gazebo and Unity
- Control systems for humanoid robots
- Perception and decision-making in physical environments
- Real-world applications of humanoid robotics

## Personalized Learning

Registered users can personalize their learning experience by clicking the "Personalize Content" button at the beginning of each chapter. This feature customizes the content based on your software and hardware background, providing a tailored learning path.

## Course Structure

This course is divided into several modules that build upon each other:

1. **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Understanding middleware for robot control
